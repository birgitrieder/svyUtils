# Introduction
svyExcelUtils is a wrapper for Apache POI's excel library and allows to read and write xls and xlsx files directly from within Servoy.

# Installation
svyExcelUtils is dependent on some external libraries, some of which are already part of Servoy's Jasper plugin. So to use the functionality, you need to install at least the basic version of the Jasper plugin available here: https://www.servoyforge.net/projects/servoy-jasperreports/files

For support of xlsx and docx (as supported by svyWordUtils), some additional libraries are required that can be downloaded here: 

# Quick start
Want to get started and do the reading later? Check out the following snippet:
```javascript
var log = scopes.svyLogManager.getLogger('com.mycompany.mysolution')
log.debug("Hello, I'm debuggin'")
var name = 'you'
log.trace("Hello {}", name) //outputs "Hello you":
```
