# Introduction
svyExcelUtils is a wrapper for Apache POI's excel library and allows to read and write xls and xlsx files directly from within Servoy.

# Installation
svyExcelUtils is dependent on some external libraries, some of which are already part of Servoy's Jasper plugin. 

# Quick start
Want to get started and do the reading later? Check out the following snippet:
```javascript
var log = scopes.svyLogManager.getLogger('com.mycompany.mysolution')
log.debug("Hello, I'm debuggin'")
var name = 'you'
log.trace("Hello {}", name) //outputs "Hello you":
```
